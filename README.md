Firebase Authentication aims to make building secure authentication systems easy, while improving the sign-in and onboarding experience for end users. It provides an end-to-end identity solution, supporting email and password accounts, phone auth, and Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub login, and more.
FirebaseUI provides a customizable, open source, drop-in auth solution that handles the UI flows for signing in users. The FirebaseUI Auth component implements best practices for authentication on mobile devices and websites, which can maximize sign-in and sign-up conversion for your app.
Built by the same team that developed Google Sign-in, Smart Lock and Chrome Password Manager, Firebase security applies Google's internal expertise of managing one of the largest account databases in the world.
It can take months to set up your own auth system, and it requires an engineering team to maintain that system in the future. Set up the entire authentication system of your app in under 10 lines of code, even handling complex cases like account merging.
